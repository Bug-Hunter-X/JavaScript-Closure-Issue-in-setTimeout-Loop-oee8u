This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue that arises when using setTimeout within a loop. The expected behavior is to log the numbers 0 through 9 after a one-second delay for each iteration.  However, due to the way closures work in JavaScript, the code incorrectly logs the value of 'i' after the loop has completed (which will be 10).  The bugSolution.js file provides a solution to this problem.
